### Etherscan.io clone (Volvox training project)

This web app makes use of Redux, React, and Node.js to display some simple information about the Ethereum blockchain. All information comes from the etherscan.io API.

 Shoutout to [Bucky Roberts](https://github.com/buckyroberts/) for his great tutorials and the React/Redux boilerplate.

#### How to run

```cd``` into the root folder in a terminal, then enter ```npm install``` followed by ```npm run start```. The app can be viewed at ```localhost:3000``` in your browser. Unfortunately as of this version, the graph does not work unless you install the [Access-Allow-Control-Origin: *](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en) extension for Chrome.
